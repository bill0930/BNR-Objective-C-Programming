# The Heap

Sometimes we need to claim a configuous chunk of memory or we called a buffer.

The buffer comes from a region of memory known as the heap, which is separate from the stack

On the heap, the buffer is independent of any functionâ€™s frame. Thus, it can be used across many functions. 

You request a buffer of memory using the function **malloc()**. 

When you are done using the buffer, you call the function **free()** to release your claim on that memory and return it to the heap.

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h> // malloc() and free() are in stdlib.h

int main(int argc, const char * argv[])
{
	// Declare a pointer
	float *startOfBuffer;
	
	// Ask to use some bytes from the heap
	startOfBuffer = malloc(1000 * sizeof(float));
	
	// ...use the buffer here...
	// Relinquish your claim on the memory so it can be reused
	free(startOfBuffer);
	
	// Forget where that memory is
	startOfBuffer = NULL;
	return 0;
}

```



`startOfBuffer` is a pointer to the address of the first floating point number in the buffer.



```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
typedef struct {
	float heightInMeters;
	int weightInKilos;
} Person;

float bodyMassIndex(Person *p)
{
return p->weightInKilos / (p->heightInMeters * p->heightInMeters);
}

int main(int argc, const char * argv[])
{
	// Allocate memory for one Person struct
	Person *mikey = (Person *)malloc(sizeof(Person));
	
	// Fill in two members of the struct
	mikey->weightInKilos = 96;
	mikey->heightInMeters = 1.7;
	
	// Print out the BMI of the original Person
	float mikeyBMI = bodyMassIndex(mikey);
	printf("mikey has a BMI of %f\n", mikeyBMI);
	
	// Let the memory be recycled
	free(mikey);
	
	// Forget where it was
	mikey = NULL;
	
	return 0;
}

```
